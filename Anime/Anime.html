        First things first, if you think anime is for children alone and stumbled upon this page, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agree_to_disagree">this</a> is where you must go. Also,
         this page represents my humble opinions alone. <br> Whoosh, with all the technicalities out of the way, what are we waiting for!
        Let's dive into the beautiful world of anime! :)

        Oooh! And one more thing!! <br> <br>
        <div class="alert">Spoilers Ahead</div>
        <br>
        I've tried to keep this as spoiler-free as possible and mark the spoilers accordingly but some nasty ones could have gone unnoticed. You have been forewarned :)

        Ah, a real tearjerker this one! This movie left me out of words, simply breathtaking. Made by the genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai">Makoto Shinkai</a>, this movie has a lot to
        offer in terms of story, art, emotion and the music. Oh the breathtaking music makes a mark everytime it starts playing. Hell, I've seen the movie n number of
        times and yet the music gives me goosebumps.

            Once in a while when I wake up. I find myself crying.
